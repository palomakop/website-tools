small web-based utilities to help me edit my website

## to do

- fix bug: in frontmatter tool, color preview is not updating when "solid color" or "notecard text color" are edited in the color picker. (though the color hex code does update correctly in the shortcode output, and the color preview shows correctly on refresh.)
- make the top section of images tool match the style of the frontmatter tool, with buttons to the right of the text instead of below. also, make the "clear all data" buttons gray instead of red.
