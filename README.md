## to do

frontmatter tool:
- fix bug: color preview is not updating when "solid color" or "notecard text color" are edited in the color picker. (though the color hex code does update correctly in the shortcode output, and the color preview shows correctly on refresh.)
  - actually, color stop color's don't update right away either, i just didn't notice because i was looking at the gradient preview.
- you should be able to scroll anywhere in the bottom container in frontmatter tool, not just inside the vertical column.
- image background styles should have a preview just like gradient background styles. (background-size: cover)
